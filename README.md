# P6Lego

This 6th semester Medialogy project investigated manual assembly labor and methods for streamlining the process in order to reduce production costs.

A system was proposed that provides aid for manually assembling LEGO models. 
The current status of the assembly is tracked in real-time by a camera using various techniques from the field of Computer Vision. This is realized in Python using the OpenCV package.
During the assembly, the user receives feedback in the form of an interactive 3D model. This model was realized in the Unity 3D game engine. 
The model highlights any errors in the assembly and indicates where the next brick is to be placed. 
Thereby, a feedback-loop is created that eliminates the possibility of making errors and thus makes manual assembly labor more efficient.
